# naive-bayes-text-classification
Naive Bayes method is a very preliminary, yet efficient way to classify text documents intro groups (e.g., classify spam or non-spam emails). Even though this method works on the bag of words (disregards the order of the words), in some cases it has up to 97% accuracy. Here, I have shown that by training on the email data set, I can get 97% accuracy and up to 96% F1-score. THe dataset is not uploaded due to copy right.
