3. Description of enhancement(s) you tried (e.g., different approach(es) to smoothing, treating common words differently, dealing with unknown words differently):

For this task, I tried two things. First, I removed all special characters from my analysis, meaning in the stage of learning and in the stage of classifying they were all ignored. Second, I tried removing 
both special characters and numbers from my analysis. Second case (removing special characters and numbers only) did not change the results in 1 significantly, for a matter of fact percision of spam increased
but percision of ham decreased, but f-scores did not change much. However, the first case, Increased my results a little bit. I think the reason was usually spam emails contain more
numbers compared to ham emails, so knowing numbers were more helpful than special characters.

4. Best performance results based on enhancements. Note that these could be the same or worse than the standard implementation.
